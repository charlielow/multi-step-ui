This example showcases a flow with complex branching, the config is auto-generated so will render differently each load.

The steps are all empty, forks will choose a random branch.

Click the auto-play button in the header to automate a random path to the end of the flow then back out again, and repeat.

There are 2 sections rendered on the page.

1. __Tree__: a visual representation of the Multi-Step UI flow tree
3. __Debug__: JSON representation of current state
